# Effective information and causal emergence in R

**Team members:** Travis Byrum, Anshuman Swain, Brennan Klein and William F Fagan

R code/package for calculating effective information in networks. This can then be used to search for macroscale representations of a network such that the coarse grained representation has more effective information than the microscale, a phenomenon known as causal emergence (see Klein and Hoel, 2020).

## Web App

A [shiny application](https://einet.shinyapps.io/einet/) is available for demonstration purposes.
